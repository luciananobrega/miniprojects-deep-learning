## Polynomial regression
We explore the effects of increasing the training dataset size, adjusting model complexity, introducing noise to the data, and employing weight decay regularization during training.

## Classification of Handwritten Digits (MNIST Dataset)
Classification using Softmax, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers, comparing accuracy and loss performance in their training and testing phases.

## Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Movie Review Dataset)
Classification using Vanilla-RNN and LSTM.

## Image Generation of Handwritten Digits (MNIST Dataset)
Using VAN and GAN.

## Image Generation (CIFAR10 Dataset)
Using VAN and GAN.
